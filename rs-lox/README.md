# Crafting Thoughts & TILs
Following [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in Rust. This is nice, I have to rethink how I implement everything, since original is in C and Rust provide much more convenience on one hand and challenges with the safety constraints. This is great both for understanding Rust and how to craft interpreters.

At first I aim to just make the thing run to spec. Later on will try to optimize some parts of it.

* `cargo t -- â€”no capture` to dump prints and dbg! During lib testing
* Debugging annoying bug, it seems that print statement doesnâ€™t put global variable on the stack. 
	* I didnâ€™t handle the NIL OpCode and posed instead of peeked for global variable setting ðŸ™ƒ ðŸ¤¡ 
		* Thatâ€™s why my pop operation was failingâ€¦
* Going to try and play with cargo workspaces. Want to separate my code into three crates, runtime (vm, opcode,

* Using `&str` as key for my global var store.
	* I store identifiers as heap strings, inside OpCode chunks. To prevent string copies, I hash the string slice (which is a pointer with length) of each identifier. 
	* I didnâ€™t want to mess with string interning, but looks like I donâ€™t have a choice. For now I gonna do the string cloning but to make previous point work I need interning.
	* Iâ€™m in a cloning hell right now

* **Representing Heap Values**
	* In C you have to allocate memory for strings on the heap but in Rust, String does that for me and gets me back a pointer, length and capacity. 
	* I simply use rustâ€™s heap instead of redoing the heap allocation myself. I might pay with perf on this. But itâ€™s much simpler and leaves room for future optimizations
